# Scripts for the paper about black holes in the Milky Way

### `softening_distance.py`
**Goal**: determine the optimal softening distance that sould be applied when evolving the system of
a given number of points.

### `bh_orbits.py`
**Goal**: determine realistic orbits for the black holes to fall onto the centre of the potantial.
Potential is computed as a multipole approximation of a set of particles representing the galaxy.

### `bh_orbits_visualizer.py`
**Goal**: predict possible orbits for the black hole from the satellite galaxy. 

### `system_generator.py`
**Goal**: create $N$-body approximation for the Milky Way as a merger of two galaxies.

### `eccentricity_example.py`
**Goal**: create example of the orbits of the black hole in a given potential.
